# KNN_Classifier
Implementation of an app using the Corona SDK and Lua that demonstrates the principle of KNN Algorithm (using pre-clustered data).

## Task List:

- Implement an app using the Corona SDK and Lua that demonstrates the principle of the kNN algorithm.  Pre-clustered data will be supplied.

- Create a three-minute video, demonstrating the functionality of your app.

- Create a document containing: 

  * A list of the functional requirements for the app.
  
  * A diagram of the app screens (you might like to use a navigation map as you used in Systems Analysis).
  
  * Evidence of appropriate configuration management and test-driven development.
  
  * A record of the black box and unit tests you have completed to verify that your app works as expected o A COCOMO predictive model, based on your pooled data in your team (include three PSP time logs per person).
